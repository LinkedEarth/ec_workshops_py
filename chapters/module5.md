Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and
interactive visualizations in Python.
- Matplotlib documentation

Matplotlib is the go-to library for plotting within Python.
If you were to learn a single plotting tool to keep in your toolbox, this is the package.

The key feature to Matplotlib is its extensibility and the extensive documentation available to the community.

Check out Project Pythia's tutorials on Matplotlib!

[Matplotlib Basics](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/core/matplotlib/matplotlib.html)
[Matplotlib Basics Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ProjectPythia/pythia-foundations/main?urlpath=lab/tree/core/matplotlib/matplotlib.ipynb)

Here is a Sandbox for you to apply what you learned.

<codeblock id="01_02">
This Binder does not remember what happened in the past.

If you copy code, for example:
```if n > 2:
    print("n is greater than 2!")
else:
    print("n is not greater than 2!")
```
it will throw an error - `n is not defined`

This is because it has forgotten who `n` is. Simply add who `n`
is at the beginning of your code, i.e.
```
n = 0
if n > 2:
    print("n is greater than 2!")
else:
    print("n is not greater than 2!")
```
