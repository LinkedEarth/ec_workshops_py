<exercise id="4" title="Introduction to NumPy">


This section contains Project Pythia's tutorials on array computing with NumPy.
We recommend using the provided Binder link to run the code.

Here is a Sandbox for you to apply what you learned.

<codeblock id="01_02">
This Binder does not remember what happened in the past.

If you copy code, for example:
```if n > 2:
    print("n is greater than 2!")
else:
    print("n is not greater than 2!")
```
it will throw an error - `n is not defined`

This is because it has forgotten who `n` is. Simply add who `n`
is at the beginning of your code, i.e.
```
n = 0
if n > 2:
    print("n is greater than 2!")
else:
    print("n is not greater than 2!")
```
