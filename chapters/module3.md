Let's start with the basics from Project Pythia. We recommend that you use the provided Binder link to follow along the article.

<codeblock id="03_01">
This Binder does not remember what happened in the past.

If you copy code, for example:
```if n > 2:
    print("n is greater than 2!")
else:
    print("n is not greater than 2!")
```
it will throw an error - `n is not defined`

This is because it has forgotten who `n` is. Simply add who `n`
is at the beginning of your code, i.e.
```
n = 0
if n > 2:
    print("n is greater than 2!")
else:
    print("n is not greater than 2!")
```

Now that you have the basics if NumPy, let's move on to more advanced functionalities
