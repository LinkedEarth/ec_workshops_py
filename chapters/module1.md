<exercise id="1" title="Why Python and Pyleoclim?">

You might be wondering why you should be learning Python.

Python is widely used in the scientific community and it is a great tool to help you further advance your geosciences research.

We will present you with the most important reasons to start using Python in the following [link](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/why-python.html).

<exercise id="2" title = "Getting Started with Python">

Now that you know why you should be learning Python, let's get started!

Read the [Quickstart zero to Python](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/quickstart.html) article.

It is always more fun to run the code by yourself. Try it out in the following cells.

Be patient - it might take a few minutes the first time you run the code. But it usually speeds up.

**Sandbox**

This space can be used as a little sandbox for you.
To try it out, click on the "run" button to execute the following chunk of code.

<codeblock id="01_01">

This is a hint

</codeblock>

If you would like to see how any code from the previous reading works, feel free to copy, paste and run it in the following code chunk box:

<codeblock id="01_02">
This Binder does not remember what happened in the past.  

If you copy code, for example:  
```
if n > 2:
    print("n is greater than 2!")
else:
    print("n is not greater than 2!")
```
it will throw an error - `n is not defined`

This is because it has forgotten who `n` is. Simply add who `n`
is at the beginning of your code, i.e.
```
n = 0
if n > 2:
    print("n is greater than 2!")
else:
    print("n is not greater than 2!")
```

</codeblock>

<exercise id="3" title="Getting Started with Jupyter">

Read the following [article](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-jupyter.html) to know more about what Jupyter is.


Then, read this [link](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/jupyterlab.html) to learn particularly about JupyterLab. Follow the exercises on an extra tab/window using the provided [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ProjectPythia/pythia-foundations/main?urlpath=lab/tree/foundations/jupyterlab.ipynb)

<exercise id="4" title="Introduction to NumPy">

~~~
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.   
It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object,  
various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an  
assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including
mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O,  
discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical  
operations, random simulation, and much more.
- NumPy Documentation
~~~

This section contains Project Pythia's tutorials on array computing with NumPy.  
We recommend using the provided Binder link to run the code.

<exercise id="5" title="Introduction to Matplotlib">

~~~
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and
interactive visualizations in Python.
- Matplotlib documentation
~~~

Matplotlib is the go-to library for plotting within Python.
If you were to learn a single plotting tool to keep in your toolbox, this is the package.

The key feature to Matplotlib is its extensibility and the extensive documentation available to the community.

Check out Project Pythia's tutorials on Matplotlib!

<exercise id="6" title="Introduction to Cartopy">

~~~
Cartopy is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing in order
to produce maps and other geospatial data analyses.

Cartopy makes use of the powerful PROJ.4, NumPy and Shapely libraries and
includes a programmatic interface built on top of Matplotlib for the creation of
publication quality maps.

Key features of Cartopy are its object-oriented projection definitions, and its
ability to transform points, lines, vectors, polygons and images between those
projections.
- Cartopy documentation
~~~

Before doing the tutorials, make sure that you already have a basic familiarity with Matplotlib.

Cartopy’s cartographic features library includes shapefiles directly served by Natural Earth.

<exercise id="7" title="Introduction to Pandas">

Pandas is a very powerful library for working with tabular data (i.e. anything you might put in a spreadsheet – a common data type in the geosciences). It allows us to use labels for our data so that we can write expressive and robust code to manipulate the data.

Key features of Pandas are the ability to read in tabular data, slice and dice data, and exploratory analysis tools native to the library.

Follow this Project Pythia tutorial on Pandas.
