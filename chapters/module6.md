<exercise id="6" title="Introduction to Cartopy">

~~~
Cartopy is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing in order
to produce maps and other geospatial data analyses.

Cartopy makes use of the powerful PROJ.4, NumPy and Shapely libraries and
includes a programmatic interface built on top of Matplotlib for the creation of
publication quality maps.

Key features of Cartopy are its object-oriented projection definitions, and its
ability to transform points, lines, vectors, polygons and images between those
projections.

Before doing the tutorials, make sure that you already have a basic familiarity with Matplotlib.

Cartopyâ€™s cartographic features library includes shapefiles directly served by Natural Earth.

[Introduction to Cartopy Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ProjectPythia/pythia-foundations/main?urlpath=lab/tree/core/cartopy/cartopy.ipynb)

Here is a Sandbox for you to apply what you learned.

<codeblock id="01_02">
This Binder does not remember what happened in the past.

If you copy code, for example:
```if n > 2:
    print("n is greater than 2!")
else:
    print("n is not greater than 2!")
```
it will throw an error - `n is not defined`

This is because it has forgotten who `n` is. Simply add who `n`
is at the beginning of your code, i.e.
```
n = 0
if n > 2:
    print("n is greater than 2!")
else:
    print("n is not greater than 2!")
```
