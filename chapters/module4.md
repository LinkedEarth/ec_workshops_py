<exercise id="7" title="Introduction to Pandas">

Pandas is a very powerful library for working with tabular data (i.e. anything you might put in a spreadsheet â€“ a common data type in the geosciences). It allows us to use labels for our data so that we can write expressive and robust code to manipulate the data.

Key features of Pandas are the ability to read in tabular data, slice and dice data, and exploratory analysis tools native to the library.
