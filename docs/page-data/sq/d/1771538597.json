{"data":{"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"A gentle introduction to the scientific Python ecosystem","description":"This is a free, open source course on how to use different Data Science Tools such as Jupyter Notebooks, relevant Python libraries, GitHub, and information about making your science FAIR. It's made possible by a long and fruitful collaboration to NSF and EarthCube. Contributions and comments on how to improve the course are welcome!

While sharable tools, methods, and cyberinfrastructure have been critical achievements for EarthCube, we find that our dedicated community is what makes our program successful. LinkedEarth builds upon EarthCube success, specifically targeting the paleogeosciences community.","showProfileImage":true,"footerLinks":[{"text":"Website","url":"https://linked.earth/"},{"text":"Source","url":"https://github.com/LinkedEarth/ec_workshops_py"},{"text":"Built with â™¥","url":"https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r"}]}}}}
