Make sure that you go through the material provided by Project Pythia before attempting the exercises. Note that the first time you build the Binder, this may take some time. Also do not navigate away from the code block (e.g., by opening another exercise) as this will stop the execution."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/module2"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Module 2: Introduction to Jupyter","description":"This module will teach you how to use Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab.

There are no LinkedEarth specific exercises related to this module."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/module3"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Module 3: Introduction to NumPy","description":"This module will teach you about NumPy. NumPy arrays are the most basic data structure for Pyleoclim, underlying all the other packages. Virtually all operations made on the data involve NumPy arrays, so it is important to understand a bit about how they work."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/module4"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Module 4: Introduction to Pandas","description":"This model will teach you how to user Pandas. Some functionalities in Pyleoclim are supported by Pandas (and we will add more in the coming year). For now, Pandas represent the easiest way to get non-LiPD formatted data into Python for use with Pyleoclim. One of the main reasons we do not use Pandas is because most its advanced capabilities require a datetime format incompatible with paleoclimate data.
