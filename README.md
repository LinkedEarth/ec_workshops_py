## Setting Up Your Own Course

This course is based on Ines Montani's Spacy course.

Quickstart instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python#:~:text=%E2%9C%85-,Quickstart,-Import%20this%20repo)

Recommended installing instructions are as follow.

### Installing Dependencies

If you would like to create your website using this repository as a base.

Instructions taken from [Course Starter](https://ines.github.io/course-starter-python/#creating-your-website-by-installing-dependencies)

**Mac instructions**

1. Make sure that you have [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) installed in order to download Node

  **The most important part of this installation is making sure that you are running some version of 10**

2. Check if you have Node installed already by using the command :
```
node --version
```

If that produces an error then you can simply download version 10 with the following command:
```
brew install node@10
```

If it’s a version other than 10, you will need to downgrade/upgrade to version 10 - or Gatsby will not be able to start a development server or build a page.

To change to version 10, follow the following commands:
```
brew search node
```
This will give you an output similar to this:

~~~out
==> Formulae
libbitcoin-node   node-build     node@12       nodeenv
llnode       node-sass      node_exporter    nodenv
node ✓       node@10       nodebrew
~~~

Next, you will want to install version 10 with the command:

~~~bash
brew install node@10
~~~

if the checkmark is currently on node we then unlink node from its current version first using:
```
brew unlink node
```

Then, link version 10 that was just installed:
```
brew link node@10
```

You may also be prompted to specify that you need to have node@10 first in your PATH so you should run the command below before attempting force linking node@10 (the command above) again:

```
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@10/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```


Sometimes, linking to node@10 will need to be forced and thus will require:
```
brew link --force --overwrite node@10
```

Next check again what version you are running to confirm that it is a version of 10. there is a possibility that an error will be produced so you can either permanently set your

```
node --version
```

this should output the following:

~~~out
v10.24.1
~~~

Now that we have this done, Gatsby’s installation and building process should be much easier.

Install Gatsby

This should a single command to complete this and will install Gatsby globally on your computer.
~~~
npm install -g gatsby-cli
~~~

**Warning:** Do not update your dependencies here.

3. Fork the repository. Then clone it locally.

4. On your terminal, locate yourself to the root of the repo.

5. In order to run on local server, we must install all relevant dependencies by running the following:
```
npm install
```
**Warning:** You will be prompted to run "npm audit fix" to fix them.
I do not recommend doing this as it may burn your site down.


During the build, you might see several ESLint errors. We are trying to fix them.
However, the output below will still build your course:

~~~out
found 572 vulnerabilities (4 low, 4 moderate, 564 high)
~~~

6. Finally, to build the site on your local:

```
npm run dev  
```

Delivering this as an output (copy and paste this address into any browser) :

~~~out
You can now view ec_workshops_py in the browser.

  http://localhost:8000/
~~~

Quick link: http://localhost:8000/

This should be the beginning of a functioning starter-course!

Now that you have a website that is deploying on your local server, we can now begin the steps to customize it to your own taste.

## Files and directory structure in the repository are as follows:
Get familiarized with the following repository architecture as you will need to work with some of the files pointed out here to do your customizations.

### Static assets

All files added to `/static` will become available at the root of the deployed
site. So `/static/image.jpg` can be referenced in your course as `/image.jpg`.
The following assets need to be available and can be customized:

| File              | Description                                              |

### Introduction on Homepage

Navigate to [`index.js`](src/pages/index.js) and modify the text in `<Layout isHome>` to match your Hackathon / course goal.

## Content

### File formats

#### Chapters

Chapters are placed in [`/chapters`](/chapters) and are Markdown files
consisting of `<exercise>` components. They'll be turned into pages, e.g.
`/chapter1`. In their frontmatter block at the top of the file, they need to
specify `type: chapter`, as well as the following meta:

```yaml
---
title: The chapter title
description: The chapter description
prev: /chapter1 # exact path to previous chapter or null to not show a link
next: /chapter3 # exact path to next chapter or null to not show a link
id: 2 # unique identifier for chapter
type: chapter # important: this creates a standalone page from the chapter
---

```

#### Slides

Slides are placed in [`/slides`](/slides) and are markdown files consisting of
slide content, separated by `---`. They need to specify the following
frontmatter block at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
type: slides
---

```

The **first and last slide** use a special layout and will display the headline
in the center of the slide. **Speaker notes** (in this case, the script) can be
added at the end of a slide, prefixed by `Notes:`. They'll then be shown on the
right next to the slides. Here's an example slides file:

```markdown
---
type: slides
---

# Processing pipelines

Notes: This is a slide deck about processing pipelines.

---

# Next slide

- Some bullet points here
- And another bullet point

<img src="/image.jpg" alt="An image located in /static" />
```

### Custom Elements

When using custom elements, make sure to place a newline between the
opening/closing tags and the children. Otherwise, Markdown content may not
render correctly.

### Setting up Binder

The [`requirements.txt`](binder/requirements.txt) in the repository defines the
packages that are installed when building it with Binder. You can specify the
binder settings like repo, branch and kernel type in the `"juniper"` section of
the `meta.json`. I'd recommend running the very first build via the interface on
the [Binder website](https://mybinder.org), as this gives you a detailed build
log and feedback on whether everything worked as expected. Enter your repository
URL, click "launch" and wait for it to install the dependencies and build the
image.

![Binder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13643239/39412757-a518d416-4c21-11e8-9dad-8b4cc14737bc.png)

If you want to use a different binder hub, you need to go to [`juniper.js`](src/components/juniper.js) in the repository and change the field in `static` - > `url`


### System Requirements

This project is developed using Binder, Gatsby and md files.  
It runs on a MacOS system.

### Key Goals

This project will teach about DS tools that can be helpful for ES research.
